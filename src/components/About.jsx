        <p className='p-about'> Hello! I'm Liveleen Kaur, a dedicated web developer on a mission to craft immersive digital experiences. 
        I'm deeply passionate about web development.
        When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me journaling , reading books or involved in art.
        These pursuits not only recharge my creativity but also inspire innovative solutions in my work.
        I believe in the power of the web to connect people and ideas, and 
        I'm committed to contributing positively to this interconnected world. 
        I thrive on engaging with fellow developers, designers, and creators to bring fresh ideas to life.
        Let's connect, collaborate, and build something amazing together. </p> 
        <h5>Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always excited to meet fellow tech enthusiasts and explore new opportunities.</h5>
